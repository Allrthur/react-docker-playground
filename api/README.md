# Hi

This is a little bit of fun i'm having with React.

## Stuff Learned

 - JSX is not HTML, you need to use className instead of class, and style needs to be passed as an object (property names also change)
 - switch type inputs have a property called "checked" that lets you see if you're checked or not (using value may not work, as it always stays on)
 - Pay close attention to what SetState changes on the application, sometimes it may not be intuitive.

## Current Objective

 - Create a toggle that makes the table visible or not. If the table is empty, show an empty table (DONE)
